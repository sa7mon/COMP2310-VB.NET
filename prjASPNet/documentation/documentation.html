			<h3>Reflection</h3>
			<p>While creating the VB.NET code for index.aspx.vb, I ran into a problem. In creating the logic to redirect the user after a successful login attempt, I kept getting an error. It would warn "Thread is being aborted" but you could just click "OK" and the program would proceed. After some research, I found that the problem was that the Response.Redirect() was raising a ThreadAbortException. I could have just wrapped that in a Try/Catch and done nothing with that exception, but it turns out that Response.Redirect() has a boolean propery named "EndResponse". If you make it false, the thread is not aborted. This is dangerous to do in some situations, but I don't have any code after the Response.Redirect() call so it's perfectly fine.</p>
			<p>The second major issue I ran into was a UX problem. After creating my sidebar and page-content sections, I could get them side-by-side, but I couldn't make them equal heights. After a lot of trial-and-error, I found a solution. If I wrapped them in a &lt;div&gt; that an "overflow: hidden" property, I could set the padding-bottom crazy high and the margin-bottom the exact opposite. This gave me the eqaul height I was looking for.</p>
