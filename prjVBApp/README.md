# Project VB Application

## Requirements
This project will demonstrate the following:
   * Create a stand-alone program using VB.NET and Visual Studio.
   * I can create a Visual Studio project for Window applications.
   * I am able to add images to the program.
   * I can utilize the Tab object to create an effective information-rich UI
   * I can utilize HTML code to make text more readable.
   * I can create a positive UX by using event handling with most input objects
   * I can use drop-down selections to populate labels throughout the application.

Watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6tQ4-kAGaQ) to see an example of what can be done with this project. This video is a simulation of the touch-screen system developed by Kim Spears at the Dotson Foundry located in Mankato, MN USA.

This is project is designed so you can demonstrate how well you as a
programmer can utilize Visual Studio and VB.NET.

This is a great project to show off your programming and UX skills by posting
the finished project or a video of the project out on your website.

The next time you are on an interview and they ask about your knowledge of
Visual Studio you can show them this project. Boom! you just got the job!

## Specifications
[Dotson Iron Castings](http://www.dotson.com/) in Mankato, MN created a
unique touch-screen system for their metal workers using Visual Studio and
the IBM I.

As the parts move through the plant the workers can view a photo pointing
out various things they need to do.

In addition there is a screen of instructions and a place for the worker to
make comments or suggestions.

For this project you will be creating a similar setup for the company of your
choice.

**Your project will demonstrate your knowledge of the following skills and
techniques:**
   * Utilize the Tab object to create an effective information-rich UI
   * Including images as part of the UI.
   * Add HTML coding to the display area of the application.
   * Use the Rich Textbox.
   * Utilize drop-down selections to populate labels throughout the application.
   * Utilize event handling for the input objects for a positive UX. The means no "Ok" or "Calc" buttons. Actions should happen as soon as the user is finished adding or changing data.

### Design Your Project
**Work out the project on paper first.**

First determine what problem the application will solve.
Next, draw out the screens showing the input from the user as well as output.
Finally, label each object on the screen with its name using the SCC naming
conventions (including prefixes such as txt, lst, html, and lbl)

### Develop the UI in Visual Studio

**Your application should include the following objects:**
   * A tab Control object utilizing at least three tab
   * A combo box
   * Labels populated from a combo box selection
   * A picture box
   * A web browser text box utilizing HTML
   * A rich text box
   * A one-line text box
   * A multi-line text box

### Write the Code in Visual Studio
**Your code should include subroutines that accomplish the following:**
   * Demonstrate how the form load can be used to select a drop-down item and populate the HTML web browser control.
   * Toggle information when the user clicks on a picture box.
   * Populate labels when the selection in the combo box changes
   * Make certain you have a detailed comment block near the top of every code file. (Include the file name, purpose of program, your name, your email, date written, and revision history)
